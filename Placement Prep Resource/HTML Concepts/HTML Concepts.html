1. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language

2. A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax.

3. XML is another markup language. XML is dynamic because it is used to transport the data not for displaying the data, whereas HTML is not.

4. HTML present version is 5. The main difference between HTML 4 and HTML 5 is that HTML 4 is the 4th and older version of HTML with fewer features and tags while HTML 5 is the extension of HTML4 and the 5th version of HTML which has new and simple features and has multiple new tags. There are no web sockets in HTML 4. It has applet tags to display the applets on web browsers. Script attribute is necessary for HTML 4 as it is used to link tag and refer to JavaScript and other similar scripts.

5. HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the element's behaviour. HTML attributes are a modifier of an HTML element type.

6. The data-attribute is used to store custom data private to the page or application. The data-attribute gives us the ability to embed custom data attributes on all HTML elements.

7. <script> = used to define a client-side script. 
<script async≥= If async is present: The script is executed asynchronously with the rest of the page (the script will be executed while the page continues the parsing) If async is not present and defer is present: The script is executed when the page has finished parsing.
<script defer≥= The defer attribute tells the browser to only execute the script file once the HTML document has been fully parsed.

8.  CSS may be used with HTML tags as style attributes as inline CSS, and also in the <head></head> section under the <style> </style> tags. similarly js may be also be written under the <head></head>.
